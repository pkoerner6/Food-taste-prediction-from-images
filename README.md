# Food taste prediction from images

The goal of this project is to predict, for unseen triplets (A, B, C), whether dish A is more similar in taste to B or C. The task involves making binary predictions (0 or 1) based on taste similarity.
For each triplet (A, B, C) in the test set, the prediction should be as follows:
- Predict 1 if the dish in image A is closer in taste to the dish in image B than to the dish in C.jpg.
- Predict 0 if the dish in image A is closer in taste to the dish in image C than to the dish in B.jpg.
